# Forking and Cloning:

1. Fork the Original Repository:
    - Go to the GitHub repository you want to contribute to.
    - Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner.
    - Check the name of your file and the owner (most times you can just leave this alone)
    - Click `Create Fork` button on the bottom right.
    - This will create a copy (fork) of the repository under your GitHub account.
1. Clone Your Fork Locally:
    1. On your local computer
        - Open your terminal.
        - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project using cd command.
    2.  Go to the Github repo you are going to clone
        - Click the `Code` Button on the upper right
        - Choose `HTTPS` (this is normally already chosen)
        - Copy the URL that you see in the modal
    3. Return to your terminal
        - Clone your forked repository using the following command `git clone <paste the repository name you copied here>`  e.g.(`git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`)
    4. Navigate to the Repository Directory: 
        - Use the cd command to enter the repository directory: (e.g. `cd repository-name`)
1. Open the Repository in VSCode:
    - Open VSCode by running `code .` in the terminal from within your repository directory.
