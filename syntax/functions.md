# FUNCTION

Functions are blocks of code that can be saved and run repeatedly. 

Syntax:

```js
    function functionName(parameter) {
    
        //any code you want goes in this function body between the curly braces
        parameter+= '!!'

        // any logic in between the curly braces must be above the return statement
        return `Hello, ${parameter}`
    }
```
