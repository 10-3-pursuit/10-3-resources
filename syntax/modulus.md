# MODULUS

# MODULUS

MODULUS mus USE a '===' and be true or false. It is asking if the first number divided by the second number has a remainder. That remainder is the number after the triple equals sign.

```js

    let num = 12

    //modulus is in the parentheses of the if statement in this example
    if(num % 2 === 0){

        console.log('I am even')

    }

```
