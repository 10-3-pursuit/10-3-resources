# Working with GitHub:

- `git clone`:
Clones a GitHub repository to your local machine.
Example: git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

- `git pull`:
Updates your local repository with changes from the remote repository.
Use this when someone else has made changes to the GitHub repository, and you want to sync your local copy.
Example: git pull origin main

- `git add`:
Stages changes for commit.
Example: git add file.txt stages "file.txt" for the next commit.

- `git commit`:
Records changes to the repository with a message.
Example: git commit -m "Added new feature"

- `git push`:
Uploads your local commits to the GitHub repository.
Example: git push origin main pushes your local changes to the "main" branch on GitHub

- `git status`:
Shows the status of your working directory and any changes you've made.
Example: git status
