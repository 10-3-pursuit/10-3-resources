# ARRAYS

An array is a data structure, and you can assign it to a variable like a number or string.

```js
const myArray = [];

console.log(myArray);

```

Arrays contain elements that are separated by commas ,. The elements can be any datatype: strings, numbers, booleans, or even another array! Though typically, elements in an array are all the same datatype.

```js
    const squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25];
```
OR

```js
    const names = ['Kris','Conner','Pablo','Soon-Mi']

```

To access an element in an array, you put the index position inside square brackets [].
Indexes always start at 0.

To access Soon-Mi:

```js
names[3]

```
